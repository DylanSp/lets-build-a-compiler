-Change Compiler to take another ostream as error output.

Change tester.cc to loop through .tutorial files in test/src and compile all of them, then execute them. 
-Maybe add an entry to Makefile for this, then tester can then just call make?
-compile first.test, second.test, probably to test/bin/first and test/bin/second
-alternatively, put test cases in tester.cc as stringstreams, feed them into compiler and have tester capture output

Figure out some way to capture output from test programs
-have them return the value of register[0] at the end of main()? 
-pass them an int*, have them set it to register[0], then check it in tester?

Get debugger working

Manage pointers in Compiler properly, probably weak pointers
-http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/274801/raw-weak-ptr-unique-ptr-shared-ptr-etc-how-to-choose-them-wisely
-update doc/stream pointers appropriately



Long-term (after finishing tutorial):
-reconstruct w/ flex/bison
-target JVM/LLVM instead of c++
-develop enhanced type-safety
-figure out interesting ideas for semantics to play with
-build a self-hosting compiler
