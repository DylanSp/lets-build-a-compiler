Refactor compile_begin/compile_end, split out stuff into separate functions.

Change Compiler to take another ostream as error output.

-Test variable_usage.test, which has multiple lines.

Get debugger working




Long-term (after finishing tutorial):
-reconstruct w/ flex/bison
-target JVM/LLVM instead of c++
-develop enhanced type-safety
-figure out interesting ideas for semantics to play with
-build a self-hosting compiler
