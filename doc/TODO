clean up code - vectors can be constructed with {elem} instead of (1, elem)
fix full_compiler to use new directory structure, add target for compiling its output in Makefile

-CompilerReader class, handles batch processing of a file - ONLY IF NECESSARY
-uses while(getline) to parse file into vector<string>, calls compile_full

Testing:
-have test_generator read from input files?
--if so, this can speed test generation, as test_generator.cc won't be changing;
  makefile can manage dependencies (have test/build/%.o depend on test/src/%.o)

-have a static enum(?) of response types in Compiler: "compilation ok", "syntax error", "type error", etc.
-test methods can check if response is right type
-compile_full() returns this type

Change Compiler to take another ostream as error output.

Long-term (after finishing tutorial):
-reconstruct w/ flex/bison
-target JVM/LLVM instead of c++
-develop enhanced type-safety
-figure out interesting ideas for semantics to play with
-build a self-hosting compiler
