-debug makefile with "make -nd <target> > test_debug"
-have "tests" target make test_generator, run it, then compile tests?

modify Makefile
-clean up references to TESTSOURCES, TESTOBJS, TEST_ARTS
-add "tests" target that makes everything in test/generated (.o to build), links with gtest_main


building object file from test: g++ -std=c++11 -I lib/googletest/googletest/include/ -c test/src/TestClass.c
building executable: g++ -pthread lib/googletest/googletest/make/gtest_main.a TestClass.o

Change Compiler to take another ostream as error output.



Get debugger working




Long-term (after finishing tutorial):
-reconstruct w/ flex/bison
-target JVM/LLVM instead of c++
-develop enhanced type-safety
-figure out interesting ideas for semantics to play with
-build a self-hosting compiler
