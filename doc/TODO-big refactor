** Merge this back into main; make separate branch for testing **

-instead of compiled output all being in main, have it output a class with get methods for register, variable, stack, and a "main" run() method
--tester (using Google Test) will hook into this class
--Compiler will need to have a way to specify classname, maybe as string param to compile_full()
--maybe have class generate its own testing methods; take as an optional param to compile_full()? (std::optional<test specification>)
---test specification would say what output to test, what to compare it too...maybe not, though. 
---vector<pair<expected value, actual quantity> >. expected value is an int, actual quantity specifies register/stack/variable, index of register/name of variable
---wrap test specification in a class/struct?

-CompilerReader class, handles batch processing of a file - ONLY IF NECESSARY
-uses while(getline) to parse file into vector<string>, calls compile_full

Testing:
-have a static enum(?) of response types in Compiler: "compilation ok", "syntax error", "type error", etc.
-test methods can check if response is right type
-compile_full() returns this type
-tester can pass strings/vector<strings> direct to compiler, not from separate input files
--still have separate output files (go in test/generated, maybe?)
-two stages:
--first: "make tests". builds test_generator.cc to bin/test_generator. this, when run, creates a bunch of compiled outputs
---each output defines a class with associated test method.
--second: "make tester". builds tester.cc and compiled outputs to bin/tester. this is a main() wrapped around Google Tests' RUN_ALL_TESTS.
