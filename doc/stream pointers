Discussion of pros/cons of using references/pointers.


Using references as members means I can only set when initialized, can't be changed after object has been constructed. This will make it difficult to run interactively.
Using a raw pointer instead of a smart pointer for simplicity and because Compiler doesn't own I/O streams. The calling code will have to manage the streams' state.
