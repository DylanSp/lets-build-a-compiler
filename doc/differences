Differences from tutorial:
-variables are looked up in a std::map
-registers are simulated by array
-functions are defined as empty lambdas, don't actually do anything. 
--if they're part of an assignment, variable gets register 0.
-compile_intermediate() handles a single line, compile_full() handles a vector of lines. 
--separation by newlines is handled by driver program (interactive_compiler, full_compiler, test_generator)
