Differences from tutorial:

Stream processing:
-No lookahead variable; use peek() instead
-No separate GetChar() function; use get() instead

Char/string processing:
-No separate isNum(), isAlpha(), isAlNum() functions; use native functions from cctype
-compile_intermediate() handles a single line (read into a stringstream), compile_full() handles a vector of lines. 
-Separation by newlines is handled by a driver program (interactive_compiler, full_compiler, test_generator).

Special characters are recognized by membership in std::unordered_set, with aid of the is_in() helper method.

Variables are looked up in a std::map.

Registers are simulated by an array

Functions:
-Functions are defined as empty lambdas, don't actually do anything. 
-if they're part of an assignment, variable gets value of register 0.
