MSDN article on exceptions, exception handling

Currently, Compiler::abort throws a std::runtime_error, which is handled in compile_intermediate(). 
For the interactive compiler, the line is aborted, and the driver program asks for the next line.
The batch compiler only calls compile_intermediate() once, so the program catches the error and stops parsing.
The parsing logic raises exceptions via calls to match(), get_name(), and get_num().
