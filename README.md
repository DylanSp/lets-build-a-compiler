# lets-build-a-compiler

In this project, I'm working through Jack Crenshaw's [Let's Build a Compiler](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/) series, published 1988-1995. Crenshaw's series used Turbo Pascal for the compiler, with Motorola 68000 assembly as the target language. I'm using C++ for both the compiler and the target language, as I'm more familiar with that. As well as learning some of the basic principles of compiler design, this project also serves as a way to refamiliarize myself with C++.
